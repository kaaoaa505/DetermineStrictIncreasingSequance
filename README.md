Given a sequence of integers as an array, 

determine whether it is possible to obtain a increasing sequence 

by removing no more than one element from the array.


**Example**

    - For a = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be solve(a) = false;

There is no one element in this array that can be removed in order to get a strictly increasing sequence.

    - For a = [1, 3, 2], the output should be solve(a) = true.

You can remove 3 from the array to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 2]. Alternately, you can remove 2 to get the strictly increasing sequence [1, 3].
